## Module 1
### Reflection 1
I applied several clean code principles in my project, such as meaningful method names and 
separation of concerns to improve maintainability and readability.

For example, I used clear naming conventions like `findById` to describe methods accurately 
and structured the code by separating Controller, Service, and Repository layers since each has 
different responsibility.

Additionally, I followed secure coding practices, such as avoiding hardcoded identifiers by using
`UUID.randomUUID()` to prevent predictable IDs.

Throughout working on this project, I experienced a problem with editing the product. I missed 
putting hidden input for the product ID in the edit form page, which made the data not change. By 
identifying and resolving this issue, I reinforced the importance of proper data binding in form submissions.
